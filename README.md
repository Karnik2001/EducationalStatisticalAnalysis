# Educational Statistical Analysis

The "Educational Statistical Analysis" project is a data analysis project developed in R. The project aims to analyze an educational dataset that includes test scores and the amount of time students spent studying. The analysis aims to gain insights into the relationship between these variables and factors that influence academic performance.
Getting Started

To get started with the project, you need to have R and RStudio installed on your computer. The R packages ggplot2, dplyr, and tidyr are also required for the analysis.
# Running the Analysis

The project's code is organized into R scripts, each focusing on a specific aspect of data analysis or visualization. To run the analysis, open the R script in RStudio and run each code chunk in sequence. The analysis includes several statistical measures such as mean, median, and standard deviation to understand the distribution of test scores and study time. The data is also visualized using scatter plots and histograms to explore the relationship between test scores and study time.
